## User Story

As a movie lover,

I want to visit an online site, where I can login, have my credentials verified and search a movie by it's title and see information on it. I then want to add/update/delete reviews for the films I have seen and see other people's thoughts on the movie too.

So that I can share my thoughts on the film and decide if I want to watch a movie from other people's reviews.
